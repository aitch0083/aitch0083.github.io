Okay, it's just a small project for me to keep me busy and from thinking too much. The goal is very simple, I create posts to show the process of solving the problems in building the CMS with [kraken.js](http://krakenjs.com/). I am not trying to show people how cool or awesome I am in this field. I am not, in the matter of fact, I am pretty lame in this field. Yes, it's a therapy for me.

I hope this processing of writing down what's in my mind can put the depression and anxiety in peace. As my wife told me: one step a time. So here is how I am gonna archive the goal:

1. List the result I want to archive
2. How I do it

One result at a time. I hope by the end of this project, I can finally be free from the voidness bothers me. You might ask why. The answer is that, I have been in this field for 10 years. But I am not a genius, or the brightest, or the smartest, or the skilled developer around. I lost the motivation ever since I had retired from the army. I need a kick from myself to prove to myself that I _can_ do something. Not the greatest or the coolest stuff, but journey to find a myself back.

### The goal of this project: to build a CMS with kraken.js and React

#THAT'S IT!!!
